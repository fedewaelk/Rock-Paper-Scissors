# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Introduction
This project is focused on creating a simple implementation of the classic game **Rock Paper Scissors**, which will be played entirely through the console. The goal is to practice and demonstrate fundamental programming skills in JavaScript, including:

- Writing functions to handle game logic.
- Generating random choices for the computer.
- Validating user input.
- Using loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.

## Problem-Solving Approach
This project emphasizes the importance of structured problem solving. The development process will follow these key steps:

1. **Plan or Pseudocode the Solution**  
   - Break the game logic into smaller, manageable steps.
   - Outline how user input and computer choices will be processed.
   - Define how to determine and display the winner of each round.

2. **Write the Code**  
   - Translate the plan into JavaScript functions and statements.

3. **Test the Code**  
   - Validate that the game runs correctly.
   - Test various inputs to ensure the logic is robust.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- Problem-solving and logical thinking.
- Understanding and application of JavaScript fundamentals.
- Writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code.
- Debugging and testing to ensure functionality.
